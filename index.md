### Description

Software foundations (or *theory of programming languages*) is the mathematical study of the *meaning* of programs. Students will learn ways to describe program behaviors, and mathematical tools to formalize and check interesting properties of programs. This course concentrates on operational techniques and type systems.

### Mailing list

Additional announcements related to the course, as well as answers to the students' questions
will be posted on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fos2020) so remember to check it frequently.

Our mailing list is hosted at [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fos2020](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fos2020),
and you *must join* it if you're attending the course - all announcements, questions and answers
will be posted there.

The mailing list is only available to registered members. In order to join the mailing list,
open the google group and click 'Apply for membership'.

### Team Registration

We encourage you to team up when working on assignments. Teams can consist of one, two or three students and should not intersect with each other. It is okay to share ideas between teams, but sharing code is prohibited.

Please fill in the form below before __September 27, Sunday__:

### Grading

Each enrolled student will receive a grade based on their results for the projects, the midterm exam and the final exam. The relative importance of each part is: 30% for projects, 30% for the midterm and 40% for the final.

### Cheating

Sharing ideas between groups is very recommended. Plagiarising code as part of a project will not be tolerated — whatever the source. In particular, you are not allowed to publish your projects in public repositories at GitHub/Bitbucket/... or to use solutions published by others.

In case of cheating, you will receive the grade “NA” (not acquired, zero) for the concerned project or exam, or for the whole course. You may furthermore be denounced and punished in accordance with the [ordonnance sur la discipline](http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/4/414.138.2.fr.pdf). If you are in any fashion worried about this, speak with an assistant.
